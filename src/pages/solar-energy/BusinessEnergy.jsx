              Self-sustaining solar power will instantly reduce your operating costs. This is because it is currently about five times cheaper than conventional electricity in the commercial sector. The more solar power you consume for your business, the more independent you become and the more you save on purchasing electricity. What’s more, you have a fixed price for electricity, which remains the same in your operating costs for decades. This helps you plan for the long term. Once the cost of the system is calculated, the price per kilowatt-hour of electricity is fixed for the entire service life. So, choose solar power and be confident in your abilities when planning your electricity costs.

            <p style={{ fontSize: '1rem', color: '#333', textAlign: 'justify' }}>
              Ideally, your solar system should generate more electricity than your business consumes. You can feed the excess into the public grid and receive a fixed 20-year tariff regulated by the Renewable Energy Act (EEG). Or you can sell the electricity directly, which is required by law from a certain system size onwards. This further increases the profitability of your PV system.
