      </p>
      <p style={{ fontSize: '1.1rem', color: '#333' }}>
        What a brilliant idea! In many countries, solar energy is already about three-quarters cheaper than regular electricity from the grid. Generating and using your own solar energy can reduce your electricity costs by at least 30%. Using an additional solar energy storage system will reduce your costs by another 80%.

      <p style={{ fontSize: '1.1rem', color: '#333' }}>
        The best way to combat unpredictable electricity prices is to produce your own electricity. Combined with a solar energy storage system, a solar installation allows you to achieve up to 80% self-sufficiency at an economically advantageous price. Favorable electricity prices, complete predictability and a high degree of independence. Enjoy the sun!

        <span className="fw-bold">Let your electricity bills melt in the sun.</span><br/>
        Self-generated solar energy is not only environmentally friendly, but also cheaper than electricity from the regular grid. The higher the share of self-generated electricity, the greater the savings. The combination of an energy management system (EMS) and solar energy storage allows you to unleash its full potential.
