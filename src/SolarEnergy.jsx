Innovative products and services. The ideal solution for everyone in the field of solar energy.

My home, my own energy.
For a world worth living in. Become self-sufficient and independent from fluctuating prices of electricity and fossil fuels! It's that simple.

Barrco Ventures offers you a complete package for hassle-free solar panel installation. We offer a full range of carefully tested components, comprehensive system planning and services such as a combined warranty. All from a single source and of the highest quality. While your new solar power plant generates electricity, you can focus on what is most important: your life.
Make your own electricity. Don't pay anymore. 
What a brilliant idea! In many countries, solar energy is already about three-quarters cheaper than regular electricity from the grid. Generating and using your own solar energy can reduce your electricity costs by at least 30%. Using an additional solar energy storage system will reduce your costs by another 80%.

Be independent, save money and care for the environment.
My electricity. My independence.
The best way to combat unpredictable electricity prices is to produce your own electricity. Combined with a solar energy storage system, a solar installation allows you to achieve up to 80% self-sufficiency at an economically advantageous price. Favorable electricity prices, complete predictability and a high degree of independence. Enjoy the sun!

Let your electricity bills melt in the sun.
Self-generated solar energy is not only environmentally friendly, but also cheaper than electricity from the regular grid. The higher the share of self-generated electricity, the greater the savings. The combination of an energy management system (EMS) and solar energy storage allows you to unleash its full potential.
 
Sustainable development is an integral part of our activities.
With us, you are taking a big step towards a sustainable energy supply independent of fossil fuels. Good to know: Solar energy systems have a huge impact on the environment and allow you to reduce CO2 emissions by several million tons annually.

                        Self-sustaining solar power will instantly reduce your operating costs. This is because it is currently about five times cheaper than conventional electricity in the commercial sector. The more solar power you consume for your business, the more independent you become and the more you save on purchasing electricity. What's more, you have a fixed price for electricity, which remains the same in your operating costs for decades. This helps you plan for the long term. Once the cost of the system is calculated, the price per kilowatt-hour of electricity is fixed for the entire service life. So, choose solar power and be confident in your abilities when planning your electricity costs.

                        Ideally, your solar system should generate more electricity than your business consumes. You can feed the excess into the public grid and receive a fixed 20-year tariff regulated by the Renewable Energy Act (EEG). Or you can sell the electricity directly, which is required by law from a certain system size onwards. This further increases the profitability of your PV system.
